# _notepad-pyqt5-python-
i had a lot of difficulty putting this together. especially the tab functionality, since it created so much problems in relation to the other functionalities like figuring out how the computer can understand which text editor is currently being used. i tried experimenting with inheritance and searched all over the internet only to learn that it was getting the index of the currently selected tab and dynamically populating each tab with a separate textbox (that might sound simple, but if you don't know how to program that you'll have a very bad time.) 

the project is still very much in progress, but it made learning pyqt5 an enjoyable process.. even though a confusing one (depending on how ambitious you are)..

EDIT:
- lmao!! hahahahaa!!! i just now realized the difference between a rich text editor (eg. microsoft word) vs. a text editor (like notepad). big difference!!
a rich text editor produces a file that can handle fancy colors, table, bullets, and highlighting etc. while a text editor cannot! simple text editors can only read plain text files and nothing else, just purely undecorated texts!! (so that's why when you try to open a .docx file in notepad you get gibberish letters, because it can't parse those to .txt format) 

damn.. but luckily i can save the file as .odt, .pdf or .html extentions which allows a rich form for text editing. all this time i was thinking that i was creating something that can replace the boring notepad, but i was wrong. i didn't even understand clearly the capabilities of both..

anyway, here it is:
