# _notepad-pyqt5-python-
i had a lot of difficulty putting this together. especially the tab functionality, since it created so much problems in relation to other functionalities. this project is still in progress. 

EDIT:
- lmao!! hahahahaa!!! i just now realized the difference between a rich text editor (eg. microsoft word) vs. a text editor (like notepad). big difference!!
a rich text editor produces a file that can handle fancy colors, table, bullets, and highlighting etc. while a text editor cannot handle and read those sophisticated features! it can only read plain text files with nothing else just purely texts!! 

damn.. but luckily i can save the file as .odt, .pdf or .html extentions which allows a rich form for text editing. all this time i was thinking that i was creating something that can replace the boring notepad, but i was wrong. i didn't even understand clearly the capabilities of both..

anyway, here it is:
